Hi, I'm Vinicius

I'm a software developer with 4+ years of experience building robust and scalable solutions for companies in different industries. My main expertise is in the **Java ecosystem**, using **Spring Boot and JPA** to develop reliable APIs, as well as integrating cloud services with **AWS** to ensure scalability and security.

But my work goes beyond technical skills. I believe technology only makes sense when it solves real problems and creates a positive impact. Thatâ€™s why I value **team collaboration**, **clear communication**, and **well-organized project management**.

## ðŸ’» My Main Stacks

- **Back-End:** Java, Spring Boot, JPA
- **Front-End:** Angular, React, JavaScript
- **Cloud & Data:** AWS (Lambda, S3, DynamoDB), SQL, NoSQL
- **Extras:** Python for automations and integrations, NodeJs for web-apps (Angular and React)

Outside of coding, I enjoy learning new technologies, exploring software architecture best practices (such as the hexagonal architecture), and finding creative ways to turn ideas into digital solutions.

Whether to collaborate on projects, exchange knowledge, or build something innovative, Iâ€™m always open to new connections.
